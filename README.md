## My process

First, I start the process of building this project by creating the html structure of the website. After that, I work on the design of the project and tried to design it as close as the expected layout on this challenge. After designing the project, I work on the responsiveness of the website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned because of this:

```css
.threeColPrevCardComp {
  width: 87.75vw;
  margin: 5.438rem auto;
  border-radius: 0.5rem; /* For this one */
  overflow: hidden; /* This one */
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to improve my fundamentals on my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Fixing 'border-radius' not working problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10995294/border-radius-not-working) - This helped me for fixing the issue regarding to the border-radius that doesn't working.
